Proxies JQ Tool ‚òëÔ∏è
- 
Tool features :
- Some people face difficulty in obtaining proxies
- so we have created a simple tool that extracts proxies from 6 sites and saves them in a file so that you can use them in our tools or tools that require a proxy.
- The number of extracted proxies is not less than 4k
- The tool also includes proxies scanning and sorting to ensure a usable proxy is used
- Supports all devices ‚úÖ
- When you run the tool, you will see two options
- 1- Checking proxies
- 2- Proxy extraction

- If you have proxies and want to check them and verify them,
- you can choose the first option,
Then the tool will ask you to enter the name of your proxy file,
- After that, the tool will ask you to enter the link of the site on which you want to check the proxies so that the tool can save the proxies that are valid for use on this site that you entered.

- If you do not have proxies and want to obtain them,
- you can use the second option to have the tool extract the proxies and save them in a file.
- After the extraction process, the tool will ask you if you want to check the proxies you extracted or not?
- If you want to check them, all you have to do is enter the number 1,
- and then you will be asked for a link to the site on which you want to check the proxies.
-----------------------
- Note that the extracted proxies will be saved in the file name: NewProxy.txt
- The checked proxies will be saved in the file name: PROXYS_Checked.txt
